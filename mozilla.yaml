  Mozillaâ€™s CA Certificate Program governs inclusion of root certificates in Network Security Services (NSS),
  a set of open source libraries designed to support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and
  server applications. The NSS root certificate store is not only used in Mozilla products such as the Firefox
  browser, but is also used by other companies in a variety of products. The program is overseen by the module
  owner and peers of the CA Certificates Module; the policy itself is overseen by the module owner and peers of
  the CA Certificate Policy Module.
