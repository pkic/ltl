  The Adobe Approved Trust List is a program that allows millions of users around the world to create digital
  signatures that are trusted whenever the signed document is opened in Adobe® Acrobat® or Reader® software. 
  Essentially, both Acrobat and Reader have been programmed to reach out to a web page to periodically download
  a list of trusted "root" digital certificates. Any digital signature created with a credential that can trace 
  a relationship ("chain") back to the high-assurance, trustworthy certificates on this list is trusted by 
  Acrobat and Reader.
