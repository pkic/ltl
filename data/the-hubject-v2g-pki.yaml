  # Hubject V2G PKI Overview


  The **Hubjecte V2G PKI (Vehicle-to-Grid Public Key Infrastructure)** is a
  security framework designed to facilitate secure communication and
  authentication between electric vehicles (EVs), charging stations, and other
  entities within the e-mobility ecosystem. It is a critical component of the
  **ISO 15118** standard, which governs **Plug & Charge** technology, allowing
  for seamless and secure EV charging without requiring physical payment methods
  or manual user authentication.



  ## **Key Components of the Hubject V2G PKI**


  ### 1. **Root Certificate Authority (Root CA)**

  - The trust anchor for the entire ecosystem.

  - Issues certificates to intermediate CAs (Sub-CAs).


  ### 2. **Subordinate Certificate Authority (Sub-CA)**

  - Issues certificates to participants such as charging stations, EV
  manufacturers, and mobility operators.

  - Ensures that entities are authenticated and authorized to participate in
  Plug & Charge.


  ### 3. **Provisioning Authority (PA)**

  - Manages the distribution of **Contract Certificates** to EV users.

  - Ensures that only valid and verified vehicles and users can participate in
  Plug & Charge transactions.


  ### 4. **Registration Authority (RA)**

  - Responsible for verifying the identity of entities before issuing
  certificates.

  - Handles certificate lifecycle processes, including issuance, renewal, and
  revocation.


  ### 5. **Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status
  Protocol (OCSP)**

  - Supports real-time validation and revocation of certificates to maintain
  system security.



  ## **How the Hubject V2G PKI Works**


  ### **1. Certificate Issuance**

  - Electric vehicle manufacturers and charging station operators obtain
  certificates from the Sub-CA.

  - EV users receive **Contract Certificates** tied to their charging
  agreements, enabling Plug & Charge.


  ### **2. Authentication Process**

  - When an EV connects to a charging station, the station verifies the
  vehicle’s Contract Certificate against the Hubject V2G PKI.

  - Mutual TLS (mTLS) is used to establish a secure communication channel.


  ### **3. Transaction Validation**

  - The charging station authenticates the EV’s certificate.

  - The EV verifies the charging station’s certificate, ensuring both parties
  are trusted.


  ### **4. Payment and Billing**

  - Once the vehicle is authenticated, the system initiates and logs the
  charging session.

  - Payment is processed automatically based on the linked Contract Certificate.



  ## **Security Features of Hubject V2G PKI**

  - **Mutual Authentication:** Both EVs and charging stations authenticate each
  other using X.509 certificates.

  - **Data Integrity:** Digital signatures protect communication from tampering.

  - **Confidentiality:** All communication is encrypted to prevent
  eavesdropping.

  - **Certificate Lifecycle Management:** Ensures timely renewal and revocation
  of certificates to maintain trust.



  ## **Key Standards and Compliance**

  - **ISO 15118-2 and ISO 15118-20:** Defines Plug & Charge communication
  protocols.

  - **ETSI and eIDAS:** Ensures compliance with European security regulations.

  - **WebTrust for CAs:** Establishes best practices for PKI operations.
