  In the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED PasspointÂ® certification program, mobile devices use Online Sign-Up (OSU) to accomplish registration and credential provisioning to obtain secure network access. Each Service Provider network has an OSU Server, an AAA Server, and access to a certificate authority (CA). A CA is a collection of computer hardware, software, and the people who operate it. The CA is known by two attributes: its name and its public key. One of the requirements for a mobile device and the hotspot to trust each other is that the OSU Server shall hold a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority whose root certificate is issued by one of the CAs authorized by Wi-Fi Alliance, and that these trusted root CA certificates are installed on the mobile device.
